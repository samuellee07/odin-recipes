    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Korean Fried Chicken, also known as KFC, is a popular Korean dish that has gained international popularity in recent years. It is known for its crispy and crunchy texture, thanks to the double-frying technique. The chicken is typically coated in a thin layer of flour or potato starch before being fried twice to achieve the desired crispiness. After frying, the chicken is often tossed in a flavorful sauce, which can range from sweet and spicy to soy garlic or honey butter. Korean Fried Chicken is loved for its juicy and tender meat, combined with the irresistible crunch of the crispy coating. It is often served as a main dish or enjoyed as a snack with friends and family.</p>
