    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A yogurt parfait is a delicious layered dessert or breakfast dish made with yogurt, granola, and fresh fruits. It typically consists of alternating layers of creamy yogurt, crunchy granola, and a variety of fruits such as berries, sliced bananas, or diced mangoes. The combination of textures and flavors creates a refreshing and satisfying treat. Yogurt parfaits are often enjoyed as a healthy and nutritious option due to the protein and probiotics found in yogurt, as well as the vitamins and fiber from the fruits and granola.</p>
